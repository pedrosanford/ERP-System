# Finance Module - Real Data Integration & Mock Data Cleanup

## Overview
Removed all mock/fake data from Finance module components and connected them to real data from HR and Student APIs. This ensures referential integrity and data consistency across the system.

## Problem Statement
The Finance module contained mock data with non-existent entities:
- **Salaries & Payroll**: "Dr. Sarah Johnson", "Mr. John Davis" (fake employees)
- **Scholarships & Discounts**: "John Doe", "Jane Smith" (fake students)
- **Department Expenses**: "Academic", "Sports" departments (non-existent departments)
- **Tuition & Fees**: "John Doe", "Jane Smith" (fake students)

This created several issues:
1. ❌ Inconsistent data across modules
2. ❌ Impossible to track real financial transactions
3. ❌ No referential integrity
4. ❌ Misleading UI showing fake data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Salaries & Payroll (`SalariesPayroll.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed mock employees "Dr. Sarah Johnson" and "Mr. John Davis"
- ✅ Added real-time fetching of active staff from HR API
- ✅ Replaced text inputs with dropdown for staff selection
- ✅ Auto-populate employee details (ID, position, department) based on selection
- ✅ Added validation to prevent salary package creation if no staff exists
- ✅ Integrated with real departments from HR API

**Key Implementation:**
```typescript
// Fetch real staff and departments
const fetchStaffAndDepartments = async () => {
  const [staffData, deptData] = await Promise.all([
    hrService.getAllStaff(),
    hrService.getAllDepartments()
  ]);
  setStaffMembers(staffData.filter(s => s.status === 'ACTIVE'));
  setDepartments(deptData);
};

// Handle staff selection
const handleStaffChange = (staffId: string) => {
  const selectedStaff = staffMembers.find(s => s.id?.toString() === staffId);
  if (selectedStaff) {
    const dept = departments.find(d => d.id === selectedStaff.departmentId);
    setSalaryForm({
      ...salaryForm,
      staffId: staffId,
      employeeName: selectedStaff.name,
      employeeId: selectedStaff.employeeId,
      position: selectedStaff.position,
      department: dept?.name || 'Unknown'
    });
  }
};
```

**UI Changes:**
- Dropdown shows: `Name (EmployeeID) - Position`
- Disabled text fields auto-fill after selection
- "No active staff found" warning if database is empty

### 2. Scholarships & Discounts (`ScholarshipsDiscounts.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed mock students "John Doe" and "Jane Smith"
- ✅ Added real-time fetching of active students from Student API
- ✅ Replaced text inputs with dropdown for student selection
- ✅ Auto-populate student details (name, program/grade) based on selection
- ✅ Added validation to prevent scholarship creation if no students exist

**Key Implementation:**
```typescript
// Fetch real students
const fetchStudents = async () => {
  const studentsData = await studentService.getAllStudents();
  setStudents(studentsData.filter(s => s.status === 'ACTIVE'));
};

// Handle student selection
const handleStudentChange = (studentId: string) => {
  const selectedStudent = students.find(s => s.id?.toString() === studentId);
  if (selectedStudent) {
    setScholarshipForm({
      ...scholarshipForm,
      studentId: studentId,
      studentName: `${selectedStudent.firstName} ${selectedStudent.lastName}`,
      grade: selectedStudent.program || ''
    });
  }
};
```

**UI Changes:**
- Dropdown shows: `FirstName LastName (StudentID) - Program`
- Disabled text fields auto-fill after selection
- "No active students found" warning if database is empty

### 3. Department Expenses (`DepartmentExpenses.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed mock departments "Academic" and "Sports"
- ✅ Added real-time fetching of departments from HR API
- ✅ Replaced static department list with dynamic list from database
- ✅ Only show real departments that exist in the system

**Key Implementation:**
```typescript
// Fetch real departments
const fetchDepartments = async () => {
  const depts = await hrService.getAllDepartments();
  setDepartments(depts);
};

// Department dropdown
<select value={expenseForm.department}>
  <option value="">Select department</option>
  {departments.map((dept: DepartmentAPI) => (
    <option key={dept.id} value={dept.name}>
      {dept.name}
    </option>
  ))}
</select>
```

**UI Changes:**
- Dropdown shows only real departments from database
- "No departments found" warning if database is empty
- Loading spinner while fetching departments

### 4. Tuition & Fees (`TuitionFees.tsx`)
**Already Fixed** (in previous task)
- ✅ Removed mock students
- ✅ Uses real students from Student API
- ✅ Dropdown for student selection in invoice generation
